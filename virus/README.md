# Common Denial-of-Service Viruses

## Virus 1 - Fork Bomb
A fork bomb creates child processes in an endless loop, rapidly consuming all available memory and CPU resources. This can result in an extremely slow system or even a complete crash.

## Virus 2 - RAM Collapse
This type of malware gradually consumes the entire RAM memory, operating slowly to avoid detection by the user.

## Virus 3 - Noise Generator
A noise generator bombards the CPU with meaningless operations, causing CPU usage to spike. The operations are typically executed randomly.

## Virus 4 - Denial of Service by Recursion
This is a recursive program that saturates the call stack, eventually causing the operating system to stall.

## Extra - Automatic process
Investigate how a process (virus) could be executed automatically everytime the SO turns on
